## v2.0
- added functions in data_processing
    - get_random_matrix creates an NxM random matrix
    - get_file_dimensions finds the number of rows and columns of a given file
    - write_matrix_to_file writes the random matrix to a CSV file 
- added plotting script plotter.py to create plots of the data 
- run.sh runs all the testing and scripts
    - I'm not sure why the unit test is failing in the github workflow but run.sh works
